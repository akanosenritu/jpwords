Both あす and あした mean "tomorrow" and are represented by "明日". In a formal situation あす is used. あした is more casual.

Only あす has, however, an extended meaning of "future". For example:
* <Ruby b="明日" t={"あす"}/>の<Ruby b={"日本"} t={"にほん"} />: Japan in the future
* <Ruby b="明日" t={"あす"}/>は<Ruby b={"我"} t={"わ"} />が<Ruby b={"身"} t={"み"} />: A saying. Referring a bad thing that happened to other people, "it can happen to me in the future".
