  answer={"が"}
  translation={"That blue vehicle is not mine. Mine is this red one."}
  rationale={<p>
    は and が are both used after the subject of a sentence. But their indications are not the same.
    は indicates the topic of the sentence. When the topic is kept in the following sentences, は will not be used.
    が, on the other hand, is simply a nominative case marker.
    In the first sentence, は appears twice.  This can be explained as:<br />
    <p style={{paddingLeft:10}}>
      The statement[topic] that "That blue car[topic of this sub sentence] is mine" is not correct.<br />
    </p>
    Since the topic of "my car" is kept in the second sentence, は cannot be used, therefore you have to choose が.
