どう and いかが have the almost same meaning of "how, in what way". The difference lies in the formality of the word. どう is more casual, and いかが is more formal.

* <Ruby t="てんき">天気</Ruby>はどうですか。(how is the weather?)
* お天気はいかがですか。(the same meaning as above but in a more formal way. Note the honorary お before 天気.)
