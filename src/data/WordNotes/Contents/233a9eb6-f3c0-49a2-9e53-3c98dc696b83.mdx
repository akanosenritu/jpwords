import {Ruby} from "../../../General/Components/Ruby"

どう and いかが have the almost same meaning of "how, in what way". The difference lies in the formality of the word. どう is more casual, and いかが is more formal.

* <Ruby b="天気" t="てんき" />はどうですか。(how is the weather?)
* お<Ruby b="天気" t="てんき" />はいかがですか。(the same meaning as above but in a more formal way. Note the honorary お before 天気.)
